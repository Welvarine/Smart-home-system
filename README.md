# Smart Home Care and Device Management System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Home Care and Device Management System** is a frontend-based web application developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The system is designed to help modern households—especially parents—monitor and manage the usage of digital and smart home devices by children.

With the rapid increase in smart appliances and digital devices in homes, parents face challenges such as excessive screen time, unsafe appliance usage, and poor digital habits. This system addresses these challenges by providing device control, monitoring, and rule enforcement to ensure safety, discipline, and responsible usage.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern households struggle to monitor and regulate the use of digital electronics by young children. This can lead to:

* Excessive screen time
* Unsafe use of appliances (e.g., ovens or stoves)
* Poor eating habits due to unrestricted fridge access

The **Smart Home Care and Device Management System** ensures safety for both children and devices by allowing parents to monitor, restrict, and control smart home appliances until proper supervision is available.

## 🚀 Features

* User authentication (Parent login and registration)
* Device management and assignment
* Rule-based monitoring of devices
* Usage reports and analytics
* Notifications when rules are violated
* Device control (ON/OFF switching)

---

## ✅ Functional Requirements

* The system shall allow a parent to **register and log in**.
* The system shall enable parents to **add devices** and assign users to them (e.g., `Tablet_John`).
* The system shall **monitor devices** based on rules defined by the parent.
* Parents shall be able to **view reports** such as screen time and device usage.
* The system shall **notify parents** when a rule is broken.
* Parents shall be able to **add, edit, or delete rules** applied to devices.
* The system shall allow parents to **delete devices** (e.g., when a child no longer needs supervision).
* The system shall allow parents to **switch appliances ON or OFF**, such as modern ovens or stoves.

## ⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** The system should respond quickly to user actions such as button clicks.
* **Reliability:** Stored data should remain safe even if the system restarts or is closed.
* **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive and easy for parents to navigate.
* **Security:** Only parents (or authorized admins) can modify device rules and regulations.
* **Availability:** The system should run smoothly without crashing during monitoring activities.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML** – Structure of the web pages
* **CSS** – Styling and layout
* **JavaScript** – Interactivity, logic, and device monitoring

---

## 📂 Project Scope

This project focuses on the **frontend implementation** of a smart home care system. It demonstrates how user interfaces and client-side logic can be used to simulate real-world smart home monitoring and control.

---

## 👩‍💻👨‍💻 Target Users

* Parents or guardians managing children’s access to smart home devices
* Students and educators studying smart home systems and web development

---

## 📌 Conclusion

The **Smart Home Care and Device Management System** provides a practical solution to managing children’s interaction with smart devices at home. By enforcing rules, monitoring usage, and enabling parental control, the system promotes safety, healthy habits, and responsible technology use.
